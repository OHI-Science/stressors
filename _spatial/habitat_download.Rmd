Using the habitats from Casey's species vulnerability work.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

# copy from his repo
from <- list.files(here::here("../spp_vuln_mapping/_data/habitat_maps"), full=TRUE)
file.copy(from=from, to = here::here("habitats/data"))

# alter names
file_list <- list.files(here::here("habitats/data"), full=TRUE)
new_file_names <- gsub("_updated", "", file_list)
file.rename(file_list, new_file_names)

```



## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
